# Prject Description

I created this project using the Slim microframework, to create the router and a middleware. 
I also used php-di to create a container to manage dependecy injection. 
The MVC pattern was used in the architecture and I created a support class, Tmdb class, 
to manage the calls to the movie db api, where this class implements an interface, that was inject in the controller.

# Installation

run `composer install` to install all dependencies and the lauch an web server to serve the application.
